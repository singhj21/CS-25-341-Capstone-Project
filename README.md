# Cyber Intrusion Detection and Visualizaion
## Idaho National Laboratory
### Short Project Description
Cyber crime is consistently evolving alongside security taction tools. Cyber security usability and data visualization has not kept pace and generally requires individuals with high expertise. Moreover, operational professionalsâ€™ collaboration with cyber professionals is lacking. This project seeks to set up a cyber network, conduct a cyber-attack on the network (e.g., Address Resolution Protocol poisoning, or malversating) leverage Zeek Network Security Monitor to detect cyber-attacks, and develop a user-friendly visualization system to convey situational awareness in terms non-cyber experts can understand.
